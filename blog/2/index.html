</a>
<p>I should begin with a disclaimer: this is an experiment, but, last week, I started working on a new library, <a href="http://dpearson.me/linalgebra/">linalgebra</a>, designed as a teaching aide. The algorithms are, almost certainly, uniformly non-optimal. That&#39;s not the point, though; I&#39;m curious as to whether taking the time to implement concepts in code will help me learn.

</p>
<p>Linear algebra is uniquely suited to this task in ways that other fields, like Calculus, aren&#39;t. For one, symbolic math is a pain, even with existing libraries, while linear algebra can be purely numeric and built upon standard data types. Meanwhile, it is imperative that any engineer has a firm grasp on at least basic concepts.

</p>
<p>As for the library, it&#39;s all written in CoffeeScript, my current favorite language, although, in retrospect (and if I didn&#39;t have so many other projects), a project like this one could have been a great opportunity to also learn a new language.

</p>
<p>So far, it seems to be helping at least a little, although I now feel like everything math-related I&#39;m analyzing through the prism of Computer Science (for the record, that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing). Still, the jury remains out on whether this project will make any difference for me, and I won&#39;t really know that until the day of the final.

</p>
<p>At any rate, the code is <a href="https://github.com/dpearson/linalgebra">on GitHub</a>. If it looks like I&#39;ve abandoned it, please bug me about it <a href="https://twitter.com/dpearson_">on Twitter</a>.

</a>
<p>TL;DR: Hockey&#39;s back. Follow NHLScoreBot in <a href="http://twitter.com/NHLScoreBot">English</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/NHLScoreBotFR">French</a> for NHL scores and game summaries on Twitter.

</p>
<p>With the NHL lockout finally resolved, it&#39;s time for another year of hockey. There&#39;s a few new features:

</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Locations. Wanted to know who the home team was? Now, your Twitter client will show a nice map on the summary&#39;s detail view.</p>
</li>
<li><p>French support. This feature is something I added last year to <a href="http://twitter.com/NFLScoreBot">NFLScoreBot</a>, and the backend update to NHLScoreBot brought it into the fold.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;ve also open sourced some more code. The arena location data I&#39;m using is available <a href="https://github.com/NHLScoreBot/arenas">on Github</a> (and you can <a href="https://github.com/NHLScoreBot/arenas#fetching-over-http">grab it with a standard HTTP request</a>).

</p>
<p>My code for using the identi.ca API with node.js is also on <a href="https://github.com/dpearson/node-identi.ca">Github</a> and <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/identica">NPM</a>.</p>

</a>
<p>We&#39;ve all thought this, at one time or another. It&#39;s a fairly easy way to procrastinate; why do something &quot;meaningless?&quot; I&#39;ve been burned recently, as you might guess. It started in November: a tied football game.

</p>
<p>Ties in the NFL are rare: only three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NFL_tied_games#Tied_games">have occurred this century</a>. As such, the support for ties in NFLScoreBot was, at best, halfhearted. In English, everything was fine; the summaries weren&#39;t particularly elegant, but it worked. As I found that day, I had never actually bothered to do the translation work for French output. I got it <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLScoreBot/status/267820582651973632">working</a>, but I&#39;ve never implemented a feature faster.

</p>
<p>I got burned again this month. The odds of two pieces of information being scored at the exact same value is ridiculously low. It happened, and I found a bug in my code that led to information being associated with the wrong team.

</p>
<p>The third time it got me? There have been <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/lists/playoff-longest-games-history-double-overtime-games-011213#tab=photo-title=2012+AFC+Playoffs%253A+Ravens+38%252C+Broncos+35&amp;photo=31533269">six double-overtime games</a> in NFL history; one of them was <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLScoreBot/status/290276493752406016">this week</a>. Thankfully, it was a quick fix.

</p>
<p>Laziness really does catch up to you. Some of these problems were things I would be unlikely to catch; the second problem came down to a single use of <code>&lt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;=</code>. 

</p>
<p>The others, though, were things I knew about. I though I could get away with them for just one more season. Then I&#39;d fix it.

</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t.

</a>
<p>At the bottom of the <a href="https://news.google.com">Google News</a> homepage is this rather interesting quote: &quot;The selection and placement of stories on this page were determined automatically by a computer program.&quot; I&#39;d never noticed it before; come to think of it, that&#39;s probably Google&#39;s intention in tucking that disclaimer at the bottom, where most people won&#39;t look (but the lawyers are just as happy).

</p>
<p>But, my criticisms of the need for such a disclaimer aside, it brings up an interesting point. If someone takes offense at a portrayal of themselves by, ultimately, an unthinking machine, what recourse are they left with? While it is absolutely wonderful that this problem exists at all, it will only become trickier to deal with as the state-of-the-art improves.

</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the courts, as far as I can tell, have not directly dealt with the issue of defamation by a computer. So, now, we get to the interesting part. While I am certainly not a lawyer, it would appear that, at least in the United States, a program cannot commit libel (assuming that it is only mentioning public figures). In the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0376_0254_ZO.html">majority opinion</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan">in New York Times v. Sullivan</a>, the bar is set at content created &quot;with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.&quot; There are two ways I see an algorithmically-generated story being contested as libel: (1) there was a bug present which caused an error in content generation or structuring or (2) a human interfered in the normal operation of said program. In the first case, the argument that the program had &quot;knowledge&quot; that the information was false is poor, as it is (in theory) in any products best interests to be accurate. In the second, however, the test of &quot;actual malice&quot; is met, albeit not by the program, but by a human. I quite honestly have no idea who would then get slapped with the lawsuit, but it would seem to me that there is at least something of a case there.

</p>
<p>This brings us to ethics, and, by necessity, to my personal views on the subject. The manipulation of a supposedly-unbiased computer &quot;author&quot; to personal ends is a gross ethical wrongdoing. However, things get somewhat murkier from here. If at all possible, automated systems should be entirely separate from their human counterparts. That way, there can be no accusations of human misconduct. To that end, the following is my policy on touching content generated by my own project, <a href="https://nflscorebot.github.com/">NFLScoreBot</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dpearson_/scorebots">friends</a>:

</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Content may be deleted or regenerated if a software bug prevented the generation of an accurate summary.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Content may be deleted or regenerated if a problem with a data source prevented the generation of an accurate summary.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Content should be generated as quickly as possible, regardless of the involved parties and my personal opinions thereof.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If content is deleted as outlined in (1) or (2), it should be regenerated as quickly as possible, regardless of the involved parties and my personal opinions thereof.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Generated content will never be manipulated by a human in any way.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The same algorithms will be used for all content generation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of that said, open source software, for full transparency, is probable best for automatic content generation. Unfortunately, I&#39;m not currently able to release any of the ScoreBots yet.</p>

			<a class="post-title" href="dpearson.me/blog/posts/NFLScoreBot+is+a+failure+But+Im+okay+with+that.html"><p>NFLScoreBot is a &quot;failure.&quot; But I&#39;m okay with that.</p>
</a>
<p><em>Edit: since I wrote this post, NFLScoreBot is doing significantly better in terms of follower numbers, and I got a decent amount of traffic when I launched my related <a href="http://scoreboard.dpearson.me">Scoreboard</a> experiment. I&#39;ve left this post up, though, as the advice is still, I feel, good.</em>

</p>
<p>It&#39;s been around a year that <a href="https://twitter.com/nflscorebot">@NFLScoreBot</a> has been tweeting, and the numbers don&#39;t lie: <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLScoreBot/followers">26 followers, including myself</a>. To add further insult to injury, some of those followers are bots (I&#39;m not sure exactly how many). The French version is even worse: a whopping <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLScoreBotFR/followers">4 followers, again, including myself</a>.

</p>
<p>I would be lying if I said these counts weren&#39;t a tad depressing. It certainly is hard to put time into something, and to feel like you&#39;ve built something neat, only to have it met with apathy. Perhaps I should have tried contacting various blogs, or done more SEO work. But this isn&#39;t really about how I failed in getting a side project before a larger audience.

</p>
<p>In the end, though, I&#39;m not entirely sure that matters. Over the course of this past year, I learned a lot. I got the experience of creating and maintaining an application that needed to stay up constantly (at least on game days). I learned a new framework, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, and a new language, <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">Coffee Script</a>. I learned about deploying to a Platform as a Service, <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and keeping a database live.

</p>
<p>Most importantly, though, I had a lot of fun doing it. I had a lot of interesting conversations during the time a presented NFLScoreBot at science fairs, up through the Virginia state science fair.

</p>
<p>Even though it wasn&#39;t as unique as I had initially thought (I read <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/04/can-an-algorithm-write-a-better-news-story-than-a-human-reporter/">Wired&#39;s article</a> on Narrative Science better software with a bit of dismay; yet another company who could make a legal argument against what I was doing!), the fact that software I wrote is generating even these rudimentary summaries for football games (a rather ludicrous task) never fails to bring a smile to my face as I see NFLScoreBot tweeting away on Sunday afternoons. For that reason, if nothing else, I&#39;ll keep the various ScoreBots running.

</p>
<p>In the end, my advice is this: it doesn&#39;t matter if your idea isn&#39;t unique. It doesn&#39;t matter if no one else cares. Build out an idea for yourself, and you might just have a blast doing it.</p>

			<a class="post-title" href="dpearson.me/blog/posts/Im+not+sure+if+I+can+bring+myself+to+buy+another+Apple+laptop.html"><p>I&#39;m not sure if I can bring myself to buy another Apple laptop</p>
</a>
<p>EDIT: The SSD <em>is</em> removable, but it <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook-Pro-with-Retina-Display-Teardown/9462/2#s36196">is proprietary</a>. My bad.

</p>
<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong: the laptops unveiled at WWDC are beautiful. The new retina MacBook Pro, especially, looks great (if only I could afford it). However, in a way, the launch and ensuing <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook-Pro-with-Retina-Display-Teardown/9462/1">teardowns</a> are a saddening commentary on the future.

</p>
<p>On current MacBook Pros, it&#39;s fairly easy to upgrade the hard drive and RAM: take out a screwdriver, pull all the screws, and lift the bottom off. From there, those components are easy enough to replace.

</p>
<p>However, with the new retina Pros (and all MacBook Airs, as far as I know), both the RAM and SSD are not easily user upgradable or removable. Ostensibly, the reason for this is space (and this is the most likely), but the conspiracy theorist in me prefers the idea that Apple wants to make a buck or two extra. In the end, I suppose, the reason doesn&#39;t really matter; the end result is the same.

</p>
<p>Upgrades are certainly an annoyance now. For my Pro, I was able to buy cheaper RAM at Best Buy, rather than install it myself. I paid around $50. Apple <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/configure/MD101LL/A?#hardware">wants double that</a>. This price delta certainly grates, but I can live with it.

</p>
<p>The bigger annoyance is, by far, that the SSD is proprietary and not user-replaceable. I suppose I take issue with this for two reasons:

</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If something happens, I can&#39;t reliably take the drive out of the machine it might have just failed in and pop it into an external enclosure (or an internal one), connected to another machine. If I really want to clone the drive, I would vastly prefer to not do it over USB; plus, this strategy opens up other options for recovering files from damaged hard drives.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What happens when you sell the thing or take it for recycling? With most laptops, you can just pop out the drive and send the rest of the machine on its merry way. A new drive is cheap enough, in most cases, for someone else to acquire, and you don&#39;t have to worry about giving away a drive with some (potentially damaging in the wrong hands) data left to be recovered.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I guess, I&#39;ll either be looking somewhere else when my Pro dies, or deciding I still like the way Apple builds hardware enough to outweigh my reluctance. Still, I really hope that this isn&#39;t the future of computing, at least for power users like myself.</p>

			<a class="post-title" href="dpearson.me/blog/posts/Ubuntu+1204+might+be+great+but+its+still+not+for+the+average+user.html"><p>Ubuntu 12.04 might be great, but it&#39;s still not for the average user</p>
</a>
<p>After reading <a href="http://lunduke.com/?p=2813">a rather nice review of Ubuntu 12.04</a>, I&#39;m still not convinced that this is really the &quot;year of the Linux desktop,&quot; nor is it, as the author proclaims, the version of Ubuntu that Windows and Mac OS X users should finally make the jump to en masse.

</p>
<p>This is, by no means, a knock against Ubuntu. It certainly is a fine Linux distribution, and it is one of the best in terms of ease of use. Under Ubuntu, unlike other distros, hardware mostly works (and it&#39;s easier to install than both Windows 7 and Lion).

</p>
<p>However, for many, the word &quot;Linux&quot; conjures up visions of text splashed across a black screen. They are, naturally, intimidated by this (admittedly unrealistic) ideal, and are unwilling to make the plunge. Then, even if they do decide to install, say Ubuntu, they are confronted <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download">with this download page</a> (Ubuntu is one of the better Linux distributions in this regard, too). They, in all likelihood, have no idea what &quot;Long Term Support&quot; means, nor what &quot;32-bit&quot; or &quot;64-bit&quot; means, other than that the former is recommended.

</p>
<p>Then, let&#39;s say they download it and burn it to a CD. The instructions here are fairly good, but heaven help you if the CD doesn&#39;t boot automatically. If that&#39;s the case, there is a nice enough page <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD">to help with that</a>, but it would probably scare the living daylights out of any non-technical user.

</p>
<p>The installation process is intimidating, certainly, but it can, and should, be improved. More problematic is the lack of any reason to make the jump to Ubuntu. There is no killer app (as cheesy as it sounds, no Angry Birds). You cannot walk into a Best Buy store and buy an Ubuntu laptop, which would help speed adoption. Unless you know Linux users, you cannot get in-person help.

</p>
<p>If Ubuntu, or any other Linux distribution, can answer those questions, then, and only then, we might see a &quot;year of the Linux desktop.&quot;</p>

			<a class="post-title" href="dpearson.me/blog/posts/Windows+8+is+the+best+OS+from+Microsoft+so+farfor+the+majority+of+users.html"><p>Windows 8 is the best OS from Microsoft so far...for the majority of users</p>
</a>
<p>After reading <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/geek-pick/a-real-user-proves-windows-8-fails-on-the-desktop-20120312/">this article</a>, I do realize that unfamiliarity is an issue. Also, Windows 8 may be a bit of a failure for power users. Still, once they get over the unfamiliarity issue, I firmly believe that Microsoft will have a hit on their hands with Windows 8.

</p>
<p>Much has been made of Microsoft&#39;s decision to bring Metro to the desktop. While, initially, it felt out of place, after a bit of use, it was the desktop that felt out of place. Legacy apps feel truly outdated, but Metro apps are nice. More importantly, Metro makes the focus about your apps and information, rather than a desktop that wastes space. For a new user, Metro (with a few hints) is, I believe, easier to pick up. Older users, especially, benefit from the large, touch-friendly targets which are both easier to see and click on.

</p>
<p>In the end, it comes down to what some view as the transition from general-purpose computer to appliance. While this represents a step backwards for some users, for 99% of users, this allows them to focus more on what they want to <em>do</em> with their computer, not how to use it. In the end, if all else fails, blame the iPad: it proved there&#39;s a market for simple appliances. Microsoft is merely following suit, and doing a good job of it.</p>

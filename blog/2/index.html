			<a class="post-title" href="http://dpearson.me/blog/posts/NHLScoreBot+Year+II.html"><p>NHLScoreBot, Year II</p>
</a>
<p>TL;DR: Hockey&#39;s back. Follow NHLScoreBot in <a href="http://twitter.com/NHLScoreBot">English</a> or <a href="http://twitter.com/NHLScoreBotFR">French</a> for NHL scores and game summaries on Twitter.

</p>
<p>With the NHL lockout finally resolved, it&#39;s time for another year of hockey. There&#39;s a few new features:

</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Locations. Wanted to know who the home team was? Now, your Twitter client will show a nice map on the summary&#39;s detail view.</p>
</li>
<li><p>French support. This feature is something I added last year to <a href="http://twitter.com/NFLScoreBot">NFLScoreBot</a>, and the backend update to NHLScoreBot brought it into the fold.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;ve also open sourced some more code. The arena location data I&#39;m using is available <a href="https://github.com/NHLScoreBot/arenas">on Github</a> (and you can <a href="https://github.com/NHLScoreBot/arenas#fetching-over-http">grab it with a standard HTTP request</a>).

</p>
<p>My code for using the identi.ca API with node.js is also on <a href="https://github.com/dpearson/node-identi.ca">Github</a> and <a href="https://npmjs.org/package/identica">NPM</a>.</p>

</a>
<p>We&#39;ve all thought this, at one time or another. It&#39;s a fairly easy way to procrastinate; why do something &quot;meaningless?&quot; I&#39;ve been burned recently, as you might guess. It started in November: a tied football game.

</p>
<p>Ties in the NFL are rare: only three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NFL_tied_games#Tied_games">have occurred this century</a>. As such, the support for ties in NFLScoreBot was, at best, halfhearted. In English, everything was fine; the summaries weren&#39;t particularly elegant, but it worked. As I found that day, I had never actually bothered to do the translation work for French output. I got it <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLScoreBot/status/267820582651973632">working</a>, but I&#39;ve never implemented a feature faster.

</p>
<p>I got burned again this month. The odds of two pieces of information being scored at the exact same value is ridiculously low. It happened, and I found a bug in my code that led to information being associated with the wrong team.

</p>
<p>The third time it got me? There have been <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/lists/playoff-longest-games-history-double-overtime-games-011213#tab=photo-title=2012+AFC+Playoffs%253A+Ravens+38%252C+Broncos+35&amp;photo=31533269">six double-overtime games</a> in NFL history; one of them was <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLScoreBot/status/290276493752406016">this week</a>. Thankfully, it was a quick fix.

</p>
<p>Laziness really does catch up to you. Some of these problems were things I would be unlikely to catch; the second problem came down to a single use of <code>&lt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;=</code>. 

</p>
<p>The others, though, were things I knew about. I though I could get away with them for just one more season. Then I&#39;d fix it.

</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t.

			<a class="post-title" href="http://dpearson.me/blog/posts/Validation+is+wonderful+(even+in+really+small+quantities).html"><p>Validation is wonderful (even in really small quantities)</p>
</a>
<p>Yesterday, up popped a notification from Tweetbot: NFLScoreBot had been <a href="http://twitter.com/KDVR/status/275396945265176576">mentioned</a> by a television station in Denver, <a href="https://twitter.com/kdvr">@KDVR</a>. When I went looking, I saw that they had used one of NFLScoreBot&#39;s tweets in their <a href="http://kdvr.com/2012/12/02/broncos-vs-bucccaneers-live-blog/">liveblog</a> of the Broncos game earlier that day.

</p>
<p>It may sound cheesy, but that realization more-or-less made my day. The project has never gotten very much attention, so even this little tidbit was wonderful to see. If I needed any motivation to stick with the project, that mention, which was probably random, provided it.

</p>
<p>Validation, like this event for me, can be simple and small, ranging from a writeup on TechCrunch to a single, solitary new user. It doesn&#39;t matter: knowing that someone thought your project valuable makes all the difference; this validation really is the most powerful motivator, even on the smallest of scales.

</p>
<p>In the end, I&#39;m likely not one to be offering advice, but I&#39;ll do it anyway: stick with your projects, even if they feel like <a href="http://dpearson.me/posts/NFLScoreBot+is+a+failure+But+Im+okay+with+that.html">failures</a>. It might just make your day, even if it&#39;s not the archetypal success story (which, for all the press these stories get, is uncommon).

</a>
<p>A little while ago, the team behind identi.ca <a href="http://identi.ca/doc/pumpio">announced</a> that they were pulling the plug on the site and moving everything over to <a href="http://pump.io">pump.io</a>. I&#39;m sure there will be a ton of benefits for identi.ca&#39;s users.

</p>
<p>The fact is, I&#39;m not one of them. I never really was. I flirted with brining NFLScoreBot over to identi.ca, which was why I built node-identi.ca to begin with. It was completely the wrong audience, but I had really only done it for fun.

</p>
<p>Pump.io will have a <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/blob/master/API.md">very different API</a>, rather than the simple, Twitter-compatible API identi.ca exposed. Therefore, I won&#39;t be updating this library to support it; the effort just isn&#39;t worth it. I&#39;ll leave the code live, as the <a href="https://github.com/dpearson/node-identi.ca/blob/master/getaccesstoken.js">authorization tool</a> is a decent example of an OAuth flow for node.js.</p>

</a>
<p>Everyone who has written even a few lines of code has heard the mantra: &quot;ship early, ship often.&quot; It&#39;s not entirely bad advice; sometimes, you do indeed have to make some compromises to get software out the door.

</p>
<p>There is, however, an unfortunate tendency when rushing to finish something, especially with a hard deadline looming. I&#39;ve taken to calling it (after a physical analogue) &quot;duct tape.&quot; In it nutshell, duct taped software is anything you&#39;re afraid to touch, lest something break. It defies refactoring attempts, and it has tremendous staying power.

</p>
<p>My cringeworthy example? NHLScoreBot. It was completely rewritten this spring to finally fix an awful mistake: initially, it was a complete fork of the codebase for the football versions.

</p>
<p>That worked great for a while. There was a lot of shared code around summary generation, and I had to quickly ship to present in a competition. Everything mostly worked, too; I had spent a bit of time chasing down all of the football-specific code. As long as I didn&#39;t breathe too loudly, it churned out decent summaries.

</p>
<p>Eventually, though, I had had enough. I spent a couple of weeks worth of free time extracting all of that shared summary-generation code into its own library. There were still sport-specific changes, but those are now miniscule. I got a lot of functionality for free, without difficult merges every time something minor changed. In short, it&#39;s what I probably should have done initially.

</p>
<p>But, looking back, it&#39;s hard to fault the duct tape too much. The horribly-rigged mashup of code specific to two completely different sports allowed me to ship quickly and bought me time for a difficult refactor. That refactor, too, was probably inevitable, and this one messy project taught me that lesson.

</p>
<p>Hopefully, it&#39;s a lesson that I won&#39;t have to relearn.

</a>
<p>I should begin with a disclaimer: this is an experiment, but, last week, I started working on a new library, <a href="http://dpearson.me/linalgebra/">linalgebra</a>, designed as a teaching aide. The algorithms are, almost certainly, uniformly non-optimal. That&#39;s not the point, though; I&#39;m curious as to whether taking the time to implement concepts in code will help me learn.

</p>
<p>Linear algebra is uniquely suited to this task in ways that other fields, like Calculus, aren&#39;t. For one, symbolic math is a pain, even with existing libraries, while linear algebra can be purely numeric and built upon standard data types. Meanwhile, it is imperative that any engineer has a firm grasp on at least basic concepts.

</p>
<p>As for the library, it&#39;s all written in CoffeeScript, my current favorite language, although, in retrospect (and if I didn&#39;t have so many other projects), a project like this one could have been a great opportunity to also learn a new language.

</p>
<p>So far, it seems to be helping at least a little, although I now feel like everything math-related I&#39;m analyzing through the prism of Computer Science (for the record, that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing). Still, the jury remains out on whether this project will make any difference for me, and I won&#39;t really know that until the day of the final.

</p>
<p>At any rate, the code is <a href="https://github.com/dpearson/linalgebra">on GitHub</a>. If it looks like I&#39;ve abandoned it, please bug me about it <a href="https://twitter.com/dpearson_">on Twitter</a>.

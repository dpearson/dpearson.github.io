</a>
<p>I think I&#39;m addicted to Twitter. Why? Every time I&#39;m the least bit bored or feeling too lazy to work, I reach for my iPad to check Twitter. I read literally every tweet that pops up in my timeline over the course of the day. When I open Tweetbot and there are no new tweets, I start looking to follow more people so that I never have that feeling again. Checking Twitter is the first thing I do when I get up in the morning. Every day.

</p>
<p>It&#39;s not just Twitter, unfortunately. Google+ and App.net are also filling similar roles, although I&#39;m slightly less obsessive-compulsive about them. Still, I wonder how much time I&#39;ve lost between those three networks over the past year, not to mention other years. My guess? Far, far too much.

</p>
<p>I suppose that this behavior is considered acceptable, if not outright encouraged, in some circles. For me, though, it has become and enormous, meaningless time suck. I&#39;ve completely quit Twitter for short periods of time in the past, and I think it&#39;s time to do it again. For one month (to start with), I won&#39;t be checking Twitter, save for my (relatively few) mentions. I might post a couple of times, but there will be no more combing through my timeline in a desperate search for something, anything to read.

</p>
<p>Hopefully, This break will give me more time to actually do stuff. I have several projects that I&#39;ve been meaning to work on which I just haven&#39;t had enough time for, in part because of Twitter. I&#39;d like to write more here, creating longer pieces that I actually own.

</p>
<p>We&#39;ll see how it goes. All I know is this: when I&#39;ve backed away from Twitter in the past, I&#39;ve felt better. I&#39;m hoping I have that feeling again.

</p>
<p>Am I crazy, or is this actually a good idea? Discuss this post <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5767983">on Hacker News</a>.</p>

</a>
<p>A little while ago, the team behind identi.ca <a href="http://identi.ca/doc/pumpio">announced</a> that they were pulling the plug on the site and moving everything over to <a href="http://pump.io">pump.io</a>. I&#39;m sure there will be a ton of benefits for identi.ca&#39;s users.

</p>
<p>The fact is, I&#39;m not one of them. I never really was. I flirted with bringing NFLScoreBot over to identi.ca, which was why I built node-identi.ca to begin with. It was completely the wrong audience, but I had really only done it for fun.

</p>
<p>Pump.io will have a <a href="https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/blob/master/API.md">very different API</a>, rather than the simple, Twitter-compatible API identi.ca exposed. Therefore, I won&#39;t be updating this library to support it; the effort just isn&#39;t worth it. I&#39;ll leave the code live, as the <a href="https://github.com/dpearson/node-identi.ca/blob/master/getaccesstoken.js">authorization tool</a> is a decent example of an OAuth flow for node.js.</p>

			<a class="post-title" href="http://dpearson.me/blog/posts/Software+duct+tape.html"><p>Software duct tape</p>
</a>
<p>Everyone who has written even a few lines of code has heard the mantra: &quot;ship early, ship often.&quot; It&#39;s not entirely bad advice; sometimes, you do indeed have to make some compromises to get software out the door.

</p>
<p>There is, however, an unfortunate tendency when rushing to finish something, especially with a hard deadline looming. I&#39;ve taken to calling it (after a physical analogue) &quot;duct tape.&quot; In it nutshell, duct taped software is anything you&#39;re afraid to touch, lest something break. It defies refactoring attempts, and it has tremendous staying power.

</p>
<p>My cringeworthy example? NHLScoreBot. It was completely rewritten this spring to finally fix an awful mistake: initially, it was a complete fork of the codebase for the football versions.

</p>
<p>That worked great for a while. There was a lot of shared code around summary generation, and I had to quickly ship to present in a competition. Everything mostly worked, too; I had spent a bit of time chasing down all of the football-specific code. As long as I didn&#39;t breathe too loudly, it churned out decent summaries.

</p>
<p>Eventually, though, I had had enough. I spent a couple of weeks worth of free time extracting all of that shared summary-generation code into its own library. There were still sport-specific changes, but those are now miniscule. I got a lot of functionality for free, without difficult merges every time something minor changed. In short, it&#39;s what I probably should have done initially.

</p>
<p>But, looking back, it&#39;s hard to fault the duct tape too much. The horribly-rigged mashup of code specific to two completely different sports allowed me to ship quickly and bought me time for a difficult refactor. That refactor, too, was probably inevitable, and this one messy project taught me that lesson.

</p>
<p>Hopefully, it&#39;s a lesson that I won&#39;t have to relearn.

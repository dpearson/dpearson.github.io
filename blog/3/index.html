			<a class="post-title" href="http://dpearson.me/blog/posts/The+iPad+minis+glaring+weakness.html"><p>The iPad mini&#39;s glaring weakness</p>
</a>
<p>Over the weekend, I had the opportunity to play with one of the new iPad minis in my local Apple store. While I must profess myself to be impressed, there did nevertheless immediately emerge one significant weakness. Spoiler alert: it&#39;s not the display.

</p>
<p>Most reviewers have dinged the display quality, but I was actually impressed with it. Granted, I was, at the time, using a first-generation iPad, but I thought the display held up well, especially given the generally-horrible in-store lighting.

</p>
<p>Rather, the problem is the device&#39;s intended orientation. When you pick the iPad mini up, it feels like a portrait device, and, that way, it is quite comfortable to hold. It certainly supports landscape orientations, though, for some reason, it doesn&#39;t feel quite right.

</p>
<p>The problem there is that, over the past two and a half years, developers, including Apple, seem to have designed for landscape first. While the built-in Mail app, again, functions in portrait, message listing is normally hidden away in the detail view, creating a minor annoyance (at least for me). On the other hand, MLB At Bat simply does not support portrait orientation on the iPad, forcing the device to be rotated.

</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m nitpicking. Maybe I&#39;m the only one who sees this as a problem. But the iPad mini&#39;s focus on portrait orientation, where it feels best in your hand, is, I think, its only real weakness.</p>

</a>
<p>At the bottom of the <a href="https://news.google.com">Google News</a> homepage is this rather interesting quote: &quot;The selection and placement of stories on this page were determined automatically by a computer program.&quot; I&#39;d never noticed it before; come to think of it, that&#39;s probably Google&#39;s intention in tucking that disclaimer at the bottom, where most people won&#39;t look (but the lawyers are just as happy).

</p>
<p>But, my criticisms of the need for such a disclaimer aside, it brings up an interesting point. If someone takes offense at a portrayal of themselves by, ultimately, an unthinking machine, what recourse are they left with? While it is absolutely wonderful that this problem exists at all, it will only become trickier to deal with as the state-of-the-art improves.

</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the courts, as far as I can tell, have not directly dealt with the issue of defamation by a computer. So, now, we get to the interesting part. While I am certainly not a lawyer, it would appear that, at least in the United States, a program cannot commit libel (assuming that it is only mentioning public figures). In the <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/historics/USSC_CR_0376_0254_ZO.html">majority opinion</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Times_Co._v._Sullivan">in New York Times v. Sullivan</a>, the bar is set at content created &quot;with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not.&quot; There are two ways I see an algorithmically-generated story being contested as libel: (1) there was a bug present which caused an error in content generation or structuring or (2) a human interfered in the normal operation of said program. In the first case, the argument that the program had &quot;knowledge&quot; that the information was false is poor, as it is (in theory) in any products best interests to be accurate. In the second, however, the test of &quot;actual malice&quot; is met, albeit not by the program, but by a human. I quite honestly have no idea who would then get slapped with the lawsuit, but it would seem to me that there is at least something of a case there.

</p>
<p>This brings us to ethics, and, by necessity, to my personal views on the subject. The manipulation of a supposedly-unbiased computer &quot;author&quot; to personal ends is a gross ethical wrongdoing. However, things get somewhat murkier from here. If at all possible, automated systems should be entirely separate from their human counterparts. That way, there can be no accusations of human misconduct. To that end, the following is my policy on touching content generated by my own project, <a href="https://nflscorebot.github.com/">NFLScoreBot</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dpearson_/scorebots">friends</a>:

</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Content may be deleted or regenerated if a software bug prevented the generation of an accurate summary.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Content may be deleted or regenerated if a problem with a data source prevented the generation of an accurate summary.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Content should be generated as quickly as possible, regardless of the involved parties and my personal opinions thereof.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If content is deleted as outlined in (1) or (2), it should be regenerated as quickly as possible, regardless of the involved parties and my personal opinions thereof.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Generated content will never be manipulated by a human in any way.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The same algorithms will be used for all content generation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of that said, open source software, for full transparency, is probable best for automatic content generation. Unfortunately, I&#39;m not currently able to release any of the ScoreBots yet.</p>

			<a class="post-title" href="http://dpearson.me/blog/posts/NFLScoreBot+is+a+failure+But+Im+okay+with+that.html"><p>NFLScoreBot is a &quot;failure.&quot; But I&#39;m okay with that.</p>
</a>
<p><em>Edit: since I wrote this post, NFLScoreBot is doing significantly better in terms of follower numbers, and I got a decent amount of traffic when I launched my related <a href="http://scoreboard.dpearson.me">Scoreboard</a> experiment. I&#39;ve left this post up, though, as the advice is still, I feel, good.</em>

</p>
<p>It&#39;s been around a year that <a href="https://twitter.com/nflscorebot">@NFLScoreBot</a> has been tweeting, and the numbers don&#39;t lie: <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLScoreBot/followers">26 followers, including myself</a>. To add further insult to injury, some of those followers are bots (I&#39;m not sure exactly how many). The French version is even worse: a whopping <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLScoreBotFR/followers">4 followers, again, including myself</a>.

</p>
<p>I would be lying if I said these counts weren&#39;t a tad depressing. It certainly is hard to put time into something, and to feel like you&#39;ve built something neat, only to have it met with apathy. Perhaps I should have tried contacting various blogs, or done more SEO work. But this isn&#39;t really about how I failed in getting a side project before a larger audience.

</p>
<p>In the end, though, I&#39;m not entirely sure that matters. Over the course of this past year, I learned a lot. I got the experience of creating and maintaining an application that needed to stay up constantly (at least on game days). I learned a new framework, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, and a new language, <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">Coffee Script</a>. I learned about deploying to a Platform as a Service, <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and keeping a database live.

</p>
<p>Most importantly, though, I had a lot of fun doing it. I had a lot of interesting conversations during the time a presented NFLScoreBot at science fairs, up through the Virginia state science fair.

</p>
<p>Even though it wasn&#39;t as unique as I had initially thought (I read <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/04/can-an-algorithm-write-a-better-news-story-than-a-human-reporter/">Wired&#39;s article</a> on Narrative Science better software with a bit of dismay; yet another company who could make a legal argument against what I was doing!), the fact that software I wrote is generating even these rudimentary summaries for football games (a rather ludicrous task) never fails to bring a smile to my face as I see NFLScoreBot tweeting away on Sunday afternoons. For that reason, if nothing else, I&#39;ll keep the various ScoreBots running.

</p>
<p>In the end, my advice is this: it doesn&#39;t matter if your idea isn&#39;t unique. It doesn&#39;t matter if no one else cares. Build out an idea for yourself, and you might just have a blast doing it.</p>

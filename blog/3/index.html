</a>
<p>We&#39;ve all thought this, at one time or another. It&#39;s a fairly easy way to procrastinate; why do something &quot;meaningless?&quot; I&#39;ve been burned recently, as you might guess. It started in November: a tied football game.

</p>
<p>Ties in the NFL are rare: only three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NFL_tied_games#Tied_games">have occurred this century</a>. As such, the support for ties in NFLScoreBot was, at best, halfhearted. In English, everything was fine; the summaries weren&#39;t particularly elegant, but it worked. As I found that day, I had never actually bothered to do the translation work for French output. I got it <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLScoreBot/status/267820582651973632">working</a>, but I&#39;ve never implemented a feature faster.

</p>
<p>I got burned again this month. The odds of two pieces of information being scored at the exact same value is ridiculously low. It happened, and I found a bug in my code that led to information being associated with the wrong team.

</p>
<p>The third time it got me? There have been <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/lists/playoff-longest-games-history-double-overtime-games-011213#tab=photo-title=2012+AFC+Playoffs%253A+Ravens+38%252C+Broncos+35&amp;photo=31533269">six double-overtime games</a> in NFL history; one of them was <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLScoreBot/status/290276493752406016">this week</a>. Thankfully, it was a quick fix.

</p>
<p>Laziness really does catch up to you. Some of these problems were things I would be unlikely to catch; the second problem came down to a single use of <code>&lt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;=</code>. 

</p>
<p>The others, though, were things I knew about. I though I could get away with them for just one more season. Then I&#39;d fix it.

</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t.

</a>
<p>Yesterday, up popped a notification from Tweetbot: NFLScoreBot had been <a href="http://twitter.com/KDVR/status/275396945265176576">mentioned</a> by a television station in Denver, <a href="https://twitter.com/kdvr">@KDVR</a>. When I went looking, I saw that they had used one of NFLScoreBot&#39;s tweets in their <a href="http://kdvr.com/2012/12/02/broncos-vs-bucccaneers-live-blog/">liveblog</a> of the Broncos game earlier that day.

</p>
<p>It may sound cheesy, but that realization more-or-less made my day. The project has never gotten very much attention, so even this little tidbit was wonderful to see. If I needed any motivation to stick with the project, that mention, which was probably random, provided it.

</p>
<p>Validation, like this event for me, can be simple and small, ranging from a writeup on TechCrunch to a single, solitary new user. It doesn&#39;t matter: knowing that someone thought your project valuable makes all the difference; this validation really is the most powerful motivator, even on the smallest of scales.

</p>
<p>In the end, I&#39;m likely not one to be offering advice, but I&#39;ll do it anyway: stick with your projects, even if they feel like <a href="http://dpearson.me/posts/NFLScoreBot+is+a+failure+But+Im+okay+with+that.html">failures</a>. It might just make your day, even if it&#39;s not the archetypal success story (which, for all the press these stories get, is uncommon).

			<a class="post-title" href="http://dpearson.me/blog/posts/The+iPad+minis+glaring+weakness.html"><p>The iPad mini&#39;s glaring weakness</p>
</a>
<p>Over the weekend, I had the opportunity to play with one of the new iPad minis in my local Apple store. While I must profess myself to be impressed, there did nevertheless immediately emerge one significant weakness. Spoiler alert: it&#39;s not the display.

</p>
<p>Most reviewers have dinged the display quality, but I was actually impressed with it. Granted, I was, at the time, using a first-generation iPad, but I thought the display held up well, especially given the generally-horrible in-store lighting.

</p>
<p>Rather, the problem is the device&#39;s intended orientation. When you pick the iPad mini up, it feels like a portrait device, and, that way, it is quite comfortable to hold. It certainly supports landscape orientations, though, for some reason, it doesn&#39;t feel quite right.

</p>
<p>The problem there is that, over the past two and a half years, developers, including Apple, seem to have designed for landscape first. While the built-in Mail app, again, functions in portrait, message listing is normally hidden away in the detail view, creating a minor annoyance (at least for me). On the other hand, MLB At Bat simply does not support portrait orientation on the iPad, forcing the device to be rotated.

</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m nitpicking. Maybe I&#39;m the only one who sees this as a problem. But the iPad mini&#39;s focus on portrait orientation, where it feels best in your hand, is, I think, its only real weakness.</p>

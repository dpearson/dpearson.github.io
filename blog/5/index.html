</a>
<p>After reading <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/geek-pick/a-real-user-proves-windows-8-fails-on-the-desktop-20120312/">this article</a>, I do realize that unfamiliarity is an issue. Also, Windows 8 may be a bit of a failure for power users. Still, once they get over the unfamiliarity issue, I firmly believe that Microsoft will have a hit on their hands with Windows 8.

</p>
<p>Much has been made of Microsoft&#39;s decision to bring Metro to the desktop. While, initially, it felt out of place, after a bit of use, it was the desktop that felt out of place. Legacy apps feel truly outdated, but Metro apps are nice. More importantly, Metro makes the focus about your apps and information, rather than a desktop that wastes space. For a new user, Metro (with a few hints) is, I believe, easier to pick up. Older users, especially, benefit from the large, touch-friendly targets which are both easier to see and click on.

</p>
<p>In the end, it comes down to what some view as the transition from general-purpose computer to appliance. While this represents a step backwards for some users, for 99% of users, this allows them to focus more on what they want to <em>do</em> with their computer, not how to use it. In the end, if all else fails, blame the iPad: it proved there&#39;s a market for simple appliances. Microsoft is merely following suit, and doing a good job of it.</p>

			<a class="post-title" href="http://dpearson.me/blog/posts/Why+our+schools+lack+technology+education.html"><p>Why our schools lack technology education</p>
</a>
<p>The common misconception is that public schools don&#39;t offer real technological education (I&#39;m talking about <em>real</em> education, not just the &quot;how to use Word&quot; classes offered) for their own reasons. While this is, to some degree, true, the bigger problem is the lack of interest on the part of students.

</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take my high school, which is in a fairly affluent area, for example. Look around in the hallways, and you will see a plethora of iPhones and Android devices. If you look at what is done with these devices, they are mostly used for accessing Facebook and Twitter, as well as sending text messages. As such, they are, in all but a few cases, consumption devices. This, in and of itself, is not a worry.

</p>
<p>The bigger problem, though, is that this generation, as a whole, has little interest in how the technology they so often use works. One can make the argument (and I have heard a fair number of people argue this) that we have the same view of cars. However, most drivers know that, when the gas pedal is pressed, fuel (gasoline) is injected into some sort of internal combustion system, which creates (through other mechanical systems) forward motion. Yet when most (and not just the young) post something to Twitter, they have no idea what is happening. More troubling, they simply don&#39;t care. The result? We have a generation that, for the first time in our history, is ambivalent about the workings of the technology that so rules their day-to-day lives.

</p>
<p>So, after that, we come to the main part: technology education. The same school I used an an earlier example offers both an &quot;Introduction to Computer Science&quot; (basically teaching the basics of Java) course and AP Computer Science. Enrollment? Fewer than ten students in the AP class and around twenty in the introductory class. There is simply no desire on the part of high school students to learn how to program, let alone to learn more advanced CS concepts.

</p>
<p>How do we, as a society, fix this? I&#39;m not sure, but we need a solution, and badly. Otherwise, we face the problem of having far too few engineers to create the hardware and software so adored by many.</p>

			<a class="post-title" href="http://dpearson.me/blog/posts/Apples+New+3rd+Party+App+Security+Model.html"><p>Apple&#39;s New 3rd Party App Security Model</p>
</a>
<p>For those who haven&#39;t heard, Apple will, starting in Mountain Lion, allow only signed apps (or those distributed via the Mac App Store) to be installed under the default settings. These settings can be changed, at least for now, but Apple has effectively mandated that developers join the Mac Developer Program ($99/year and requires a credit card, both of which rule out young developers). Unlike iOS, unsigned apps can still be install, but the user must change a setting that they may not know how to change or may not feel comfortable changing.

</p>
<p>The fact ignored by many people touting <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/security.html">Gatekeeper</a> is that some users have no idea how to change even the simplest of settings. I&#39;ve seen customers in the Apple Store being instructed by a staff member on how to use <em>Google Maps</em>. Do I really think that is someone able to figure out how to allow unsigned applications, even with a step-by-step tutorial? No, and to some degree that&#39;s a good thing. For that type of user, living within Apple&#39;s walled garden is fine. They don&#39;t have to worry as heavily about malware, and, as a result, they feel safer. However, it also means that developers intending to distribute apps without signing them, such as those who cannot or will not join the Mac Developer Program, cannot count on everyone being able to install them.

</p>
<p>This marks a sharp departure from the way the Mac platform has been, and the lack of an outcry is surprising, at least in light of the backlash over Apple <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/03/xcode-4-unifies-design-and-code-view-available-to-all-for-499.ars">selling Xcode 4 for $5</a> last year. If $5 is a lot of money for a young developer just starting out to pay, then how is $99 any better? Yes, you can still distribute apps without signing them, but you rule out potential users and provide an extra hurdle for anyone testing or using any app created.

</p>
<p>So, with the exception of apps targeted at developers, there now is a bit of a quandary: if an app isn&#39;t signed, will you be losing a chunk of potential customers? The <a href="http://dcurt.is/gatekeeper-s-dialog">dialog shown</a> when, under the aforementioned default settings, an unsigned app is run is scary enough to force most users to delete the app just as quick as they can, and could seriously anger anyone who paid for the app. Therefore, can a paid app be distributed unsigned, and even a free one? The answer should be &quot;yes,&quot; but, in light of the default settings in Mountain Lion, it will become &quot;no.&quot;</p>

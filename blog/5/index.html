			<a class="post-title" href="http://dpearson.me/blog/posts/Ubuntu+1204+might+be+great+but+its+still+not+for+the+average+user.html"><p>Ubuntu 12.04 might be great, but it&#39;s still not for the average user</p>
</a>
<p>After reading <a href="http://lunduke.com/?p=2813">a rather nice review of Ubuntu 12.04</a>, I&#39;m still not convinced that this is really the &quot;year of the Linux desktop,&quot; nor is it, as the author proclaims, the version of Ubuntu that Windows and Mac OS X users should finally make the jump to en masse.

</p>
<p>This is, by no means, a knock against Ubuntu. It certainly is a fine Linux distribution, and it is one of the best in terms of ease of use. Under Ubuntu, unlike other distros, hardware mostly works (and it&#39;s easier to install than both Windows 7 and Lion).

</p>
<p>However, for many, the word &quot;Linux&quot; conjures up visions of text splashed across a black screen. They are, naturally, intimidated by this (admittedly unrealistic) ideal, and are unwilling to make the plunge. Then, even if they do decide to install, say Ubuntu, they are confronted <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download">with this download page</a> (Ubuntu is one of the better Linux distributions in this regard, too). They, in all likelihood, have no idea what &quot;Long Term Support&quot; means, nor what &quot;32-bit&quot; or &quot;64-bit&quot; means, other than that the former is recommended.

</p>
<p>Then, let&#39;s say they download it and burn it to a CD. The instructions here are fairly good, but heaven help you if the CD doesn&#39;t boot automatically. If that&#39;s the case, there is a nice enough page <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD">to help with that</a>, but it would probably scare the living daylights out of any non-technical user.

</p>
<p>The installation process is intimidating, certainly, but it can, and should, be improved. More problematic is the lack of any reason to make the jump to Ubuntu. There is no killer app (as cheesy as it sounds, no Angry Birds). You cannot walk into a Best Buy store and buy an Ubuntu laptop, which would help speed adoption. Unless you know Linux users, you cannot get in-person help.

</p>
<p>If Ubuntu, or any other Linux distribution, can answer those questions, then, and only then, we might see a &quot;year of the Linux desktop.&quot;</p>

</a>
<p>After reading <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/geek-pick/a-real-user-proves-windows-8-fails-on-the-desktop-20120312/">this article</a>, I do realize that unfamiliarity is an issue. Also, Windows 8 may be a bit of a failure for power users. Still, once they get over the unfamiliarity issue, I firmly believe that Microsoft will have a hit on their hands with Windows 8.

</p>
<p>Much has been made of Microsoft&#39;s decision to bring Metro to the desktop. While, initially, it felt out of place, after a bit of use, it was the desktop that felt out of place. Legacy apps feel truly outdated, but Metro apps are nice. More importantly, Metro makes the focus about your apps and information, rather than a desktop that wastes space. For a new user, Metro (with a few hints) is, I believe, easier to pick up. Older users, especially, benefit from the large, touch-friendly targets which are both easier to see and click on.

</p>
<p>In the end, it comes down to what some view as the transition from general-purpose computer to appliance. While this represents a step backwards for some users, for 99% of users, this allows them to focus more on what they want to <em>do</em> with their computer, not how to use it. In the end, if all else fails, blame the iPad: it proved there&#39;s a market for simple appliances. Microsoft is merely following suit, and doing a good job of it.</p>

			<a class="post-title" href="http://dpearson.me/blog/posts/Why+our+schools+lack+technology+education.html"><p>Why our schools lack technology education</p>
</a>
<p>The common misconception is that public schools don&#39;t offer real technological education (I&#39;m talking about <em>real</em> education, not just the &quot;how to use Word&quot; classes offered) for their own reasons. While this is, to some degree, true, the bigger problem is the lack of interest on the part of students.

</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take my high school, which is in a fairly affluent area, for example. Look around in the hallways, and you will see a plethora of iPhones and Android devices. If you look at what is done with these devices, they are mostly used for accessing Facebook and Twitter, as well as sending text messages. As such, they are, in all but a few cases, consumption devices. This, in and of itself, is not a worry.

</p>
<p>The bigger problem, though, is that this generation, as a whole, has little interest in how the technology they so often use works. One can make the argument (and I have heard a fair number of people argue this) that we have the same view of cars. However, most drivers know that, when the gas pedal is pressed, fuel (gasoline) is injected into some sort of internal combustion system, which creates (through other mechanical systems) forward motion. Yet when most (and not just the young) post something to Twitter, they have no idea what is happening. More troubling, they simply don&#39;t care. The result? We have a generation that, for the first time in our history, is ambivalent about the workings of the technology that so rules their day-to-day lives.

</p>
<p>So, after that, we come to the main part: technology education. The same school I used an an earlier example offers both an &quot;Introduction to Computer Science&quot; (basically teaching the basics of Java) course and AP Computer Science. Enrollment? Fewer than ten students in the AP class and around twenty in the introductory class. There is simply no desire on the part of high school students to learn how to program, let alone to learn more advanced CS concepts.

</p>
<p>How do we, as a society, fix this? I&#39;m not sure, but we need a solution, and badly. Otherwise, we face the problem of having far too few engineers to create the hardware and software so adored by many.</p>

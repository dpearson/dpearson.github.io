			<h2><p>My month off Twitter</p>
</h2>
			<p>Almost two months ago, I wrote <a href="http://dpearson.me/blog/posts/Addicted+to+Twitter.html">a post</a> about being &quot;addicted&quot; to Twitter. It wasn&#39;t an addiction in the traditional, medical sense, but I was spending far, far too much time constantly checking Twitter, neglecting other aspects of my life. Then, I wrote that I would be stepping back from Twitter for a month, in order to gain a better perspective.

</p>
<p>Now, it&#39;s been , and I kept my promise, staying off Twitter for a month, save for the week of WWDC. For that week, Twitter was my way of following along with the people lucky enough to be there in person, to find out what sessions were worth watching and which ones I could skip.

</p>
<p>Twitter certainly is wonderful for news consumption and even (dare I say) as a replacement for RSS. That, though, is the problem: sometimes, I&#39;ve gotten a case of information overload. During my month away from Twitter, I was able to write more code, even if I didn&#39;t write much prose here. I felt more at peace and more relaxed than I had in ages. Even though giving up Twitter wasn&#39;t the sole reason for that relaxation, I believe that this experiment was responsible in no small part.

</p>
<p>I also learned more about why I spend so much time on Twitter. My friends are wonderful, but they&#39;re not nearly as interested in technology as I am. Twitter, in that sense, represents a connection, however tenuous, to a world of people that I&#39;ve never had the chance to be a true part of. That&#39;s not something that I really want to give up.</p>

			<h2><p>Autism and Vaccines: The Great Lie</p>
</h2>
			<p><em>This post was inspired by a recent trip to the local book store, where I saw yet another book apparently offering a cure for autism.</em>

</p>
<p><em>I&#39;ve tried my best to provide sources for every fact and statistic I&#39;ve cited and to stick to the facts.You may or may not agree with me.</em>

</p>
<hr>
<p>Most of you will, no doubt, be familiar with the &quot;vaccines cause autism&quot; argument, but I&#39;ll begin with some background (which you can <a href="#now">skip</a>).

</p>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p><a name="background"></a>

</p>
<p>Generally, this accusation stems from research done in 1998 by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield">Andrew Wakefield</a> on the MMR vaccine, which protects against the measles (and related diseases), although there are similar theories involving mercury and other chemicals.

</p>
<p>Since its publication, Wakefield&#39;s paper has been <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)60175-4/fulltext">retracted</a> by the Lancet, the original publisher. The British Journal of Medicine has <a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452">called</a> his work &quot;an elaborate fraud.&quot; The UK Department of Health <a href="http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_105189.pdf">offers</a> only one word in response to the question of the MMR vaccine and autism: &quot;No.&quot;

</p>
<p>Perhaps the most damning commentary, however, comes from Dr. Paul Offit&#39;s remarks<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> to <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/06/eveningnews/main7220709.shtml">CBS News</a>:

</p>
<p>&quot;Four children died from measles. Three died in Ireland, one died in England, died from a disease that was perfectly and safely prevented by a vaccine, died because of that paper. That paper killed four children.&quot;

</p>
<h3>Now</h3>
<p><a name="now"></a>

</p>
<p>But the myth just won&#39;t die.

</p>
<p>Supporters are, sadly, widespread: in parts of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana, more than 20% of children aren&#39;t properly vaccinated according to the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702303863404577284001227981464.html">Wall Street Journal</a>. Egged on by B-list celebrities like <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/interviews/mccarthy.html">Jenny McCarty</a> <sup><a href="#2">2</a></sup>, a third of parents nation-wide claim to be worried about a potential link to autism <sup><a href="#3">3</a></sup>.

</p>
<p>More alarming, though, is this: the Autism Society of America, which <a href="http://www.autism-society.org/about-us/">calls</a> itself &quot;the nation&#39;s leading grassroots autism organization,&quot; apparently <a href="http://www.autism-society.org/research/environmental-health-initiative/autism-and-vaccines.html">condones</a> the link between vaccines and autism in calling for &quot;research into the causal or contributory relationship to autism that may be attributed to thimerosal containing vaccines (TCV&#39;s), the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) inoculation and/or a combination of the two&quot; and stating that &quot;All those who are vaccine injured need to be justly compensated.&quot; <sup><a href="#4">4</a></sup>

</p>
<p>Autism Speaks, another major advocacy group for those with autism, sends a more conflicting message; they more-or-less <a href="http://blog.autismspeaks.org/2012/01/06/autism-in-the-news-01-05-12/">ridicule</a> Wakefield&#39;s research and link to any number of articles opposing any sort of causation, but the group&#39;s cofounder <a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/advocacy/advocacy-news/bob-wright-tells-congress-face-crisis">testified</a> before a House committee that more needs to be done on vaccine safety. Autism Speaks has also <a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/science/grants/vaccination-regression-study">funded</a> research as recently as 2009 into a possible link and <a href="http://www.autismspeaks.org/resource/richard-gage-pc">provides</a> information on vaccine attorneys to parents. <sup><a href="#5">5</a></sup>

</p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p><a name="why"></a>

</p>
<p>It&#39;s easy to look at the various studies, which all either find no sign of causation or have been discredited, or the comments from various scientific and political groups, like the CDC, and be puzzled. There is, scientifically, no reason to believe that autism and vaccines have anything to do with each other, but there is a human one: desperation.

</p>
<p>I can only imagine what it must feel like when a parent is told that their kid has autism; I&#39;ve seen firsthand the struggles of raising a child with autism, and it&#39;s <em>hard</em>. The people supporting this theory aren&#39;t evil; they are parents who genuinely want the best for their children.

</p>
<p>The fact is, though, that we know next to nothing about autism, aside from a handful of potential environmental factors. We don&#39;t even know what it <em>is</em>, let alone definitively what causes it. If we did, I am certain that the changes necessary to eliminate that factor, at least in the developed world, would be immediately undertaken.

</p>
<p>For now, though, the great lie of vaccines as the cause of autism is the best fearful parents have to cling to.

<p><em>If you have comments, I&#39;d love to hear them <a href="https://twitter.com/dpearson_">on Twitter</a> (I&#39;m @dpearson_) or <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">on Hacker News</a>.</em>

<h5>Notes</h5>
<p><a name="1" href="#1">1</a>: Yes, I&#39;m aware of accusations made of a conflict of interest. Yes, I understand these accusations. No, it doesn&#39;t change the fact that these deaths were caused by a preventable disease.

</p>
<p><a name="2" href="#2">2</a>: As far as I&#39;m aware, Jenny McCarthy isn&#39;t related to the more famous McCarthy, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_McCarthy">Joe</a>, although he, too, led a fear-mongering campaign.

</p>
<p><a name="3" href="#3">3</a>: These parents are also be very, very vocal themselves: I got into an argument on Twitter a while back on this subject, which quickly turned into an &quot;us against the world&quot; type of argument (including the traditional conspiracy comments).

</p>
<p><a name="4" href="#4">4</a>: I have contacted the ASA for clarification and have not heard back.

</p>
<p><a name="5" href="#5">5</a>: I have contacted Autism Speaks for clarification and have not heard back.</p>

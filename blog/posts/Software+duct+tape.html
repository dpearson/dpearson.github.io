			<h2><p>Software duct tape</p>
</h2>
			<p>Everyone who has written even a few lines of code has heard the mantra: &quot;ship early, ship often.&quot; It&#39;s not entirely bad advice; sometimes, you do indeed have to make some compromises to get software out the door.

</p>
<p>There is, however, an unfortunate tendency when rushing to finish something, especially with a hard deadline looming. I&#39;ve taken to calling it (after a physical analogue) &quot;duct tape.&quot; In it nutshell, duct taped software is anything you&#39;re afraid to touch, lest something break. It defies refactoring attempts, and it has tremendous staying power.

</p>
<p>My cringeworthy example? NHLScoreBot. It was completely rewritten this spring to finally fix an awful mistake: initially, it was a complete fork of the codebase for the football versions.

</p>
<p>That worked great for a while. There was a lot of shared code around summary generation, and I had to quickly ship to present in a competition. Everything mostly worked, too; I had spent a bit of time chasing down all of the football-specific code. As long as I didn&#39;t breathe too loudly, it churned out decent summaries.

</p>
<p>Eventually, though, I had had enough. I spent a couple of weeks worth of free time extracting all of that shared summary-generation code into its own library. There were still sport-specific changes, but those are now miniscule. I got a lot of functionality for free, without difficult merges every time something minor changed. In short, it&#39;s what I probably should have done initially.

</p>
<p>But, looking back, it&#39;s hard to fault the duct tape too much. The horribly-rigged mashup of code specific to two completely different sports allowed me to ship quickly and bought me time for a difficult refactor. That refactor, too, was probably inevitable, and this one messy project taught me that lesson.

</p>
<p>Hopefully, it&#39;s a lesson that I won&#39;t have to relearn.

</a>
<p>For those who haven&#39;t heard, Apple will, starting in Mountain Lion, allow only signed apps (or those distributed via the Mac App Store) to be installed under the default settings. These settings can be changed, at least for now, but Apple has effectively mandated that developers join the Mac Developer Program ($99/year and requires a credit card, both of which rule out young developers). Unlike iOS, unsigned apps can still be install, but the user must change a setting that they may not know how to change or may not feel comfortable changing.

</p>
<p>The fact ignored by many people touting <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/mountain-lion/security.html">Gatekeeper</a> is that some users have no idea how to change even the simplest of settings. I&#39;ve seen customers in the Apple Store being instructed by a staff member on how to use <em>Google Maps</em>. Do I really think that is someone able to figure out how to allow unsigned applications, even with a step-by-step tutorial? No, and to some degree that&#39;s a good thing. For that type of user, living within Apple&#39;s walled garden is fine. They don&#39;t have to worry as heavily about malware, and, as a result, they feel safer. However, it also means that developers intending to distribute apps without signing them, such as those who cannot or will not join the Mac Developer Program, cannot count on everyone being able to install them.

</p>
<p>This marks a sharp departure from the way the Mac platform has been, and the lack of an outcry is surprising, at least in light of the backlash over Apple <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2011/03/xcode-4-unifies-design-and-code-view-available-to-all-for-499.ars">selling Xcode 4 for $5</a> last year. If $5 is a lot of money for a young developer just starting out to pay, then how is $99 any better? Yes, you can still distribute apps without signing them, but you rule out potential users and provide an extra hurdle for anyone testing or using any app created.

</p>
<p>So, with the exception of apps targeted at developers, there now is a bit of a quandary: if an app isn&#39;t signed, will you be losing a chunk of potential customers? The <a href="http://dcurt.is/gatekeeper-s-dialog">dialog shown</a> when, under the aforementioned default settings, an unsigned app is run is scary enough to force most users to delete the app just as quick as they can, and could seriously anger anyone who paid for the app. Therefore, can a paid app be distributed unsigned, and even a free one? The answer should be &quot;yes,&quot; but, in light of the default settings in Mountain Lion, it will become &quot;no.&quot;</p>

</a>
<p>I have yet another blog. Maybe, just maybe, I&#39;ll actually write a little more here than I have on my past couple of blogs.

</p>
<p>As for the technical details, I rolled my own static blogging engine in <a href="http://nodejs.org">node.js</a> (of course). Posts are written in markdown and parsed with <a href="https://github.com/chjj/marked">marked</a>, then compiled into a little static site. I might open source it later, but the code is really ugly for now.</p>

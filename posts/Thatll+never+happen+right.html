			<h2><p>That&#39;ll never happen, right?</p>
</h2>
			<p>We&#39;ve all thought this, at one time or another. It&#39;s a fairly easy way to procrastinate; why do something &quot;meaningless?&quot; I&#39;ve been burned recently, as you might guess. It started in November: a tied football game.

</p>
<p>Ties in the NFL are rare: only three <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NFL_tied_games#Tied_games">have occurred this century</a>. As such, the support for ties in NFLScoreBot was, at best, halfhearted. In English, everything was fine; the summaries weren&#39;t particularly elegant, but it worked. As I found that day, I had never actually bothered to do the translation work for French output. I got it <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLScoreBot/status/267820582651973632">working</a>, but I&#39;ve never implemented a feature faster.

</p>
<p>I got burned again this month. The odds of two pieces of information being scored at the exact same value is ridiculously low. It happened, and I found a bug in my code that led to information being associated with the wrong team.

</p>
<p>The third time it got me? There have been <a href="http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/lists/playoff-longest-games-history-double-overtime-games-011213#tab=photo-title=2012+AFC+Playoffs%253A+Ravens+38%252C+Broncos+35&amp;photo=31533269">six double-overtime games</a> in NFL history; one of them was <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLScoreBot/status/290276493752406016">this week</a>. Thankfully, it was a quick fix.

</p>
<p>Laziness really does catch up to you. Some of these problems were things I would be unlikely to catch; the second problem came down to a single use of <code>&lt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;=</code>. 

</p>
<p>The others, though, were things I knew about. I though I could get away with them for just one more season. Then I&#39;d fix it.

</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t.</p>

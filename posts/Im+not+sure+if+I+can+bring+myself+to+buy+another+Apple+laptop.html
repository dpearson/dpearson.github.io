</h2><p>Don&#39;t get me wrong: the laptops unveiled at WWDC are beautiful. The new retina MacBook Pro, especially, looks great (if only I could afford it). However, in a way, the launch and ensuing <a href="http://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/MacBook-Pro-with-Retina-Display-Teardown/9462/1">teardowns</a> are a saddening commentary on the future.

</p>
<p>On current MacBook Pros, it&#39;s fairly easy to upgrade the hard drive and RAM: take out a screwdriver, pull all the screws, and lift the bottom off. From there, those components are easy enough to replace.

</p>
<p>However, with the new retina Pros (and all MacBook Airs, as far as I know), both the RAM and the SSD are soldered to the board and are not user upgradable or removable. Ostensibly, the reason for this is space (and this is the most likely), but the conspiracy theorist in me prefers the idea that Apple wants to make a buck or two extra. In the end, I suppose, the reason doesn&#39;t really matter; the end result is the same.

</p>
<p>Upgrades are certainly an annoyance now. For my Pro, I was able to buy cheaper RAM at Best Buy, rather than install it myself. I paid around $50. Apple <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/configure/MD101LL/A?#hardware">wants double that</a>. This price delta certainly grates, but I can live with it.

</p>
<p>The bigger annoyance is, by far, that the SSD is not removable. I suppose I take issue with this for two reasons:

</p>
<ol>
<li><p>If something happens, I can&#39;t reliably take the drive out of the machine it might have just failed in and pop it into an external enclosure (or an internal one), connected to another machine. If I really want to clone the drive, I would vastly prefer to not do it over USB; plus, this strategy opens up other options for recovering files from damaged hard drives.</p>
</li>
<li><p>What happens when you sell the thing or take it for recycling? With most laptops, you can just pop out the drive and send the rest of the machine on its merry way. A new drive is cheap enough, in most cases, for someone else to acquire, and you don&#39;t have to worry about giving away a drive with some (potentially damaging in the wrong hands) data left to be recovered.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, I guess, I&#39;ll either be looking somewhere else when my Pro dies, or deciding I still like the way Apple builds hardware enough to outweigh my reluctance. Still, I really hope that this isn&#39;t the future of computing, at least for power users like myself.</p>

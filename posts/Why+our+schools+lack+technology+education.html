</h2><p>The common misconception is that public schools don&#39;t offer real technological education (I&#39;m talking about <em>real</em> education, not just the &quot;how to use Word&quot; classes offered) for their own reasons. While this is, to some degree, true, the bigger problem is the lack of interest on the part of students.

</p>
<p>Let&#39;s take my high school, which is in a fairly affluent area, for example. Look around in the hallways, and you will see a plethora of iPhones and Android devices. If you look at what is done with these devices, they are mostly used for accessing Facebook and Twitter, as well as sending text messages. As such, they are, in all but a few cases, consumption devices. This, in and of itself, is not a worry.

</p>
<p>The bigger problem, though, is that this generation, as a whole, has little interest in how the technology they so often use works. One can make the argument (and I have heard a fair number of people argue this) that we have the same view of cars. However, most drivers know that, when the gas pedal is pressed, fuel (gasoline) is injected into some sort of internal combustion system, which creates (through other mechanical systems) forward motion. Yet when most (and not just the young) post something to Twitter, they have no idea what is happening. More troubling, they simply don&#39;t care. The result? We have a generation that, for the first time in our history, is ambivalent about the workings of the technology that so rules their day-to-day lives.

</p>
<p>So, after that, we come to the main part: technology education. The same school I used an an earlier example offers both an &quot;Introduction to Computer Science&quot; (basically teaching the basics of Java) course and AP Computer Science. Enrollment? Fewer than ten students in the AP class and around twenty in the introductory class. There is simply no desire on the part of high school students to learn how to program, let alone to learn more advanced CS concepts.

</p>
<p>How do we, as a society, fix this? I&#39;m not sure, but we need a solution, and badly. Otherwise, we face the problem of having far too few engineers to create the hardware and software so adored by many.</p>

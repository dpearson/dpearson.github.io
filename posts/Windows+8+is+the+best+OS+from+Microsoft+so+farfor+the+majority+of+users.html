			<h2><p>Windows 8 is the best OS from Microsoft so far...for the majority of users</p>
</h2>
			<p>After reading <a href="http://www.geek.com/articles/geek-pick/a-real-user-proves-windows-8-fails-on-the-desktop-20120312/">this article</a>, I do realize that unfamiliarity is an issue. Also, Windows 8 may be a bit of a failure for power users. Still, once they get over the unfamiliarity issue, I firmly believe that Microsoft will have a hit on their hands with Windows 8.

</p>
<p>Much has been made of Microsoft&#39;s decision to bring Metro to the desktop. While, initially, it felt out of place, after a bit of use, it was the desktop that felt out of place. Legacy apps feel truly outdated, but Metro apps are nice. More importantly, Metro makes the focus about your apps and information, rather than a desktop that wastes space. For a new user, Metro (with a few hints) is, I believe, easier to pick up. Older users, especially, benefit from the large, touch-friendly targets which are both easier to see and click on.

</p>
<p>In the end, it comes down to what some view as the transition from general-purpose computer to appliance. While this represents a step backwards for some users, for 99% of users, this allows them to focus more on what they want to <em>do</em> with their computer, not how to use it. In the end, if all else fails, blame the iPad: it proved there&#39;s a market for simple appliances. Microsoft is merely following suit, and doing a good job of it.</p>

</h2><p>I attend a school in a fairly well-off county. They claim education to be their primary, and sole, focus. Call me jaded, but this is, in the elegant words of many high school students, <em>bullshit</em>.

</p>
<p>I live in Fairfax County, which (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Highest-income_counties_in_the_United_States#2009">per Wikipedia</a>) featured the third-highest median income in the United States in 2009. It was, for the record, beat out by a city within the county boundary and by a neighboring county. Therefore, on the whole, the problem is not one of money; there&#39;s plenty of that if priorities were properly set. Granted, I attend a school that draws from some poorer areas, but the school district, as a whole, does not want for money.

</p>
<p>Let&#39;s back up for a moment, and take a look at some figures. Per the Virginia Department of Education, Herndon High, achieves pass rates ranging from 95% in English all the way down to 87% pass rates on state end of course science exams. These, scarily enough, are overall figures balanced out by bright students from high income households. That 87% pass rate in science? How does <em>63%</em> sound for students with disabilities? This is worse than the overall pass rate for students with disabilities on the same tests in the rest of the county (74%, to be exact) and in the state as a whole (weighing in at 70%). </p>

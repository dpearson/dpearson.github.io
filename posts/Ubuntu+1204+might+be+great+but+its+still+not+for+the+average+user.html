</h2><p>After reading <a href="http://lunduke.com/?p=2813">a rather nice review of Ubuntu 12.04</a>, I&#39;m still not convinced that this is really the &quot;year of the Linux desktop,&quot; nor is it, as the author proclaims, the version of Ubuntu that Windows and Mac OS X users should finally make the jump to en masse.

</p>
<p>This is, by no means, a knock against Ubuntu. It certainly is a fine Linux distribution, and it is one of the best in terms of ease of use. Under Ubuntu, unlike other distros, hardware mostly works (and it&#39;s easier to install than both Windows 7 and Lion).

</p>
<p>However, for many, the word &quot;Linux&quot; conjures up visions of text splashed across a black screen. They are, naturally, intimidated by this (admittedly unrealistic) ideal, and are unwilling to make the plunge. Then, even if they do decide to install, say Ubuntu, they are confronted <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/ubuntu/download">with this download page</a> (Ubuntu is one of the better Linux distributions in this regard, too). They, in all likelihood, have no idea what &quot;Long Term Support&quot; means, nor what &quot;32-bit&quot; or &quot;64-bit&quot; means, other than that the former is recommended.

</p>
<p>Then, let&#39;s say they download it and burn it to a CD. The instructions here are fairly good, but heaven help you if the CD doesn&#39;t boot automatically. If that&#39;s the case, there is a nice enough page <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/BootFromCD">to help with that</a>, but it would probably scare the living daylights out of any non-technical user.

</p>
<p>The installation process is intimidating, certainly, but it can, and should, be improved. More problematic is the lack of any reason to make the jump to Ubuntu. There is no killer app (as cheesy as it sounds, no Angry Birds). You cannot walk into a Best Buy store and buy an Ubuntu laptop, which would help speed adoption. Unless you know Linux users, you cannot get in-person help.

</p>
<p>If Ubuntu, or any other Linux distribution, can answer those questions, then, and only then, we might see a &quot;year of the Linux desktop.&quot;</p>

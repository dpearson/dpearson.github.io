</h2></a><p>Over the weekend, I had the opportunity to play with one of the new iPad minis in my local Apple store. While I must profess myself to be impressed, there did nevertheless immediately emerge one significant weakness. Spoiler alert: it&#39;s not the display.

</p>
<p>Most reviewers have dinged the display quality, but I was actually impressed with it. Granted, I was, at the time, using a first-generation iPad, but I thought the display held up well, especially given the generally-horrible in-store lighting.

</p>
<p>Rather, the problem is the device&#39;s intended orientation. When you pick the iPad mini up, it feels like a portrait device, and, that way, it is quite comfortable to hold. It certainly supports landscape orientations, though, for some reason, it doesn&#39;t feel quite right.

</p>
<p>The problem there is that, over the past two and a half years, developers, including Apple, seem to have designed for landscape first. While the built-in Mail app, again, functions in portrait, message listing is normally hidden away in the detail view, creating a minor annoyance (at least for me). On the other hand, MLB At Bat simply does not support portrait orientation on the iPad, forcing the device to be rotated.

</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m nitpicking. Maybe I&#39;m the only one who sees this as a problem. But the iPad mini&#39;s focus on portrait orientation, where it feels best in your hand, is, I think, its only real weakness.</p>

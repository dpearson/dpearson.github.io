</h2></a><p>Yesterday, up popped a notification from Tweetbot: NFLScoreBot had been <a href="http://twitter.com/KDVR/status/275396945265176576">mentioned</a> by a television station in Denver, <a href="https://twitter.com/kdvr">@KDVR</a>. When I went looking, I saw that they had used one of NFLScoreBot&#39;s tweets in their <a href="http://kdvr.com/2012/12/02/broncos-vs-bucccaneers-live-blog/">liveblog</a> of the Broncos game earlier that day.

</p>
<p>It may sound cheesy, but that realization more-or-less made my day. The project has never gotten very much attention, so even this little tidbit was wonderful to see. If I needed any motivation to stick with the project, that mention, which was probably random, provided it.

</p>
<p>Validation, like this event for me, can be simple and small, ranging from a writeup on TechCrunch to a single, solitary new user. It doesn&#39;t matter: knowing that someone thought your project valuable makes all the difference; this validation really is the most powerful motivator, even on the smallest of scales.

</p>
<p>In the end, I&#39;m likely not one to be offering advice, but I&#39;ll do it anyway: stick with your projects, even if they feel like failures. It might just make your day, even if it&#39;s not the archetypal success story (which, for all the press these stories get, is uncommon).

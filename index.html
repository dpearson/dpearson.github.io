	<h2><p>A Different Way to Learn Linear Algebra</p>
</h2>
</a>
<p>I should begin with a disclaimer: this is an experiment, but, last week, I started working on a new library, <a href="http://dpearson.me/linalgebra/">linalgebra</a>, designed as a teaching aide. The algorithms are, almost certainly, uniformly non-optimal. That&#39;s not the point, though; I&#39;m curious as to whether taking the time to implement concepts in code will help me learn.

</p>
<p>Linear algebra is uniquely suited to this task in ways that other fields, like Calculus, aren&#39;t. For one, symbolic math is a pain, even with existing libraries, while linear algebra can be purely numeric and built upon standard data types. Meanwhile, it is imperative that any engineer has a firm grasp on at least basic concepts.

</p>
<p>As for the library, it&#39;s all written in CoffeeScript, my current favorite language, although, in retrospect (and if I didn&#39;t have so many other projects), a project like this one could have been a great opportunity to also learn a new language.

</p>
<p>So far, it seems to be helping at least a little, although I now feel like everything math-related I&#39;m analyzing through the prism of Computer Science (although that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing). Still, the jury remains out on whether this project will make any difference for me, and I won&#39;t really know that until the day of the final.

</p>
<p>At any rate, the code is <a href="https://github.com/dpearson/linalgebra">on GitHub</a>. If it looks like I&#39;ve abandoned it, please bug me about it <a href="https://twitter.com/dpearson_">on Twitter</a>.</p>

</h2></a><p>We at Consumer Reports labs have heard the same rumors about the new MacBook Pros and Airs, and we pride ourselves on keeping our subscribers informed about potential purchases. Therefore, we took an early look at how we might bash this latest piece of junk to come out of Cupertino.

</p>
<h3>The screen</h3>
<p>From what we&#39;ve seen, the retina display that could be on the newest Mac laptops might be the sharpest display anyone but us has ever seen. Still, we far prefer the 3D displays we&#39;ve seen on laptops with 1.5 hours of battery life (bonus feature: when you pick them up, the case flexes). The retina display also will be a huge drain on battery life; this Apple product will likely <em>only</em> get the same battery life as its predecessor, a measly five hours; we&#39;ve seen competing products get much higher battery life when plugged in.

</p>
<h3>Under the hood</h3>
<p>Given that the new Apple laptops will almost certainly have the latest Ivy Bridge chips, we can only complain that Apple will ship computers that do not have i7 processors. These chips are the fatest we&#39;ve seen, and Apple makes an unfortunate trade-off in optimizing for things no one cares about, like battery life and making computers that don&#39;t remind users of standing near the Space Shuttle at launch.

</p>
<p>We also know that 4 GB of memory is not enough, especially for those who enjoy using resource-intensive programs like Microsoft Word and iTunes. In addition, the dubious inclusion of solid state drives will force compromises on those better served with slow, heat-generating 1 TB hard drives.

</p>
<h3>Final Verdict</h3>
<p>We know that many product purchasers rely on Consumer Reports&#39; expert advice prior to purchasing any product, so here it is: don&#39;t buy whatever laptops Apple might come out with. Besides the fact that we&#39;re contractually obligated to not recommend any Apple products, it might actually be better than not only previous models in the same line, but also better than other, competing products.

</p>
<p>Still, we will be sure to thoroughly test these new Apple laptops, whenever they come out, by waiting in line at the nearest Best Buy to purchase one, then running it through the same gauntlet of tests used to evaluate tosters. Make sure to subscribe and stay tuned for out complete testing results.

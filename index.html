But I&#39;m okay with that.</p>
</h2></a><p>It&#39;s been around a year that <a href="https://twitter.com/nflscorebot">@NFLScoreBot</a> has been tweeting, and the numbers don&#39;t lie: <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLScoreBot/followers">26 followers, including myself</a>. To add further insult to injury, some of those followers are bots (I&#39;m not sure exactly how many). The French version is even worse: a whopping <a href="https://twitter.com/NFLScoreBotFR/followers">4 followers, again, including myself</a>.

</p>
<p>I would be lying if I said these counts weren&#39;t a tad depressing. It certainly is hard to put time into something, and to feel like you&#39;ve built something neat, only to have it met with apathy. Perhaps I should have tried contacting various blogs, or done more SEO work. But this isn&#39;t really about how I failed in getting a side project before a larger audience.

</p>
<p>In the end, though, I&#39;m not entirely sure that matters. Over the course of this past year, I learned a lot. I got the experience of creating and maintaining an application that needed to stay up constantly (at least on game days). I learned a new framework, <a href="http://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, and a new language, <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">Coffee Script</a>. I learned about deploying to a Platform as a Service, <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> and keeping a database live.

</p>
<p>Most importantly, though, I had a lot of fun doing it. I had a lot of interesting conversations during the time a presented NFLScoreBot at science fairs, up through the Virginia state science fair.

</p>
<p>Even though it wasn&#39;t as unique as I had initially thought (I read <a href="http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2012/04/can-an-algorithm-write-a-better-news-story-than-a-human-reporter/">Wired&#39;s article</a> on Narrative Science better software with a bit of dismay; yet another company who could make a legal argument against what I was doing!), the fact that software I wrote is generating even these rudimentary summaries for football games (a rather ludicrous task) never fails to bring a smile to my face as I see NFLScoreBot tweeting away on Sunday afternoons. For that reason, if nothing else, I&#39;ll keep the various ScoreBots running.

</p>
<p>In the end, my advice is this: it doesn&#39;t matter if your idea isn&#39;t unique. It doesn&#39;t matter if no one else cares. Build out an idea for yourself, and you might just have a blast doing it.</p>
